            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "explanation": "Operating a jackleg drill exposes you to loud noise and potential eye hazards from flying debris. Hearing protection is crucial to prevent hearing loss, safety glasses/goggles protect your eyes, and steel-toed boots guard against foot injuries from falling objects. A hard hat is also essential but not included in the given options.",

              "Continue with pre-blast procedures, as the mat is still partially functional.",
              "Inform the blaster-in-charge and immediately replace or repair the damaged mat before proceeding.",

              "Temporarily cover the damaged area with sandbags and continue with the blast."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Damaged blasting mats pose a significant safety hazard. Exposed steel cables can become projectiles during the blast.

              "Proceed cautiously, holding your breath, to assess the blast area quickly.",
              "Immediately retreat to a safe distance and notify the blaster-in-charge and ventilation personnel about the potential presence of post-blast gases.",
              "Don your respirator and proceed with the inspection, assuming the fumes are dissipating.",
              "Use a handheld fan to clear the fumes and then proceed with the inspection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-blast gases can be extremely hazardous. The presence of visible fumes and the odor of explosives indicates incomplete combustion or residual gases. The safest course of action is to retreat immediately and notify the blaster-in-charge and ventilation personnel. They will assess the situation, determine the appropriate ventilation measures, and clear the area before re-entry is permitted. Using a respirator is good, but the most important action is to notify the blast-in-charge.",

              "Approve the plan, assuming the blaster-in-charge is competent and has used detonators before.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure the safety of the blasting crew. If a new type of detonator is being used, it is crucial to understand its properties, handling procedures, and potential hazards. Requesting additional information and training ensures that everyone involved is competent and knowledgeable, minimizing the risk of accidents. Simply assuming competence or closely monitoring the crew is not sufficient. Rejecting the plan outright may not be necessary if proper training is provided.",

        "description": "This comprehensive training video provides a detailed overview of blasting operations in mining, emphasizing safety protocols and best practices to minimize risks and ensure a safe working environment. Blasting is a crucial process in many mining operations, but it also presents significant hazards if not performed correctly. This video aims to equip miners with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the entire blasting process, from pre-blast inspections and planning to post-blast assessments and hazard mitigation. By adhering to the procedures outlined in this video, miners can significantly reduce the potential for accidents, injuries, and equipment damage, contributing to a safer and more productive mining operation.\n\nSpecifically, this training will cover topics such as the types of explosives used in mining, proper handling and storage procedures, safe loading and stemming techniques, initiation methods, misfire procedures, and the importance of effective communication throughout the blasting process. Furthermore, the video addresses the environmental impact of blasting and the importance of minimizing dust and noise pollution. It emphasizes the critical role of pre-blast surveys, risk assessments, and post-blast inspections in identifying and mitigating potential hazards. Understanding and implementing these principles is essential for all personnel involved in or working near blasting operations.",
